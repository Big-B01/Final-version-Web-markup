                    If you look on the picture on your left you might have already noticed the picture you see here 
                    and the picture you saw before are the exact same building the only difference is this picture was taken in 1911 
                    and the picture on the home page was made in 2023. 
                    Not much change right? But don’t think for a second Zandvoort is still a old village 
                    where the time hasn't passed. Let us show you some amazing facts about Zanvoort
                </p>

                <h2>
                    did u know Zandvoort has existed since the early 1100’s? 
                </h2>

                <p class="homepageText1">
                    Crazy to think this little town is even older then the Notre-dame in France, 
                    the tower of Pisa in Italy, 
                    The Chinese wall and even The White House. 
                    Not too bad for a small village in the Netherlands
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Did u know back in the 18 and 1900’s  Zandvoort was even more known then Amsterdam? 
                </h2>

                <p class="homepageText1">
                    Zandvoort was one of the most well known places cause it was one of the biggest and 
                    most popular bathing places. The reason why is that back then swimming and seeing the sea was a luxury that not many people could do due to the travelling

                <h2>
                    Did u know the formula 1 track 1st race was in 1948?
                </h2>

                <p class="homepageText1">
                    The race track was first used to 1948 till 1953, 1955, 1958 till 1971, 1973 till 1985. 
                    in 1886 the track seemed to old and the organisation had no funding and because of that the grand prix 
                    stayed away from Zandvoort, until 2018 there were rumours that the formula 1 would come back to Zandvoort, 
                    unfortunately when corona hit all of that got put on hold and in 2020 when corona cooled down, 
                    they still had some problems cause people had the argument that if the f1 would be held, there would be too much air 
                    pollution and the nature around it would also be affected. When the case came to the judge the judge ruled in the tracks favour 
                    and in 2021 Max Verstappen could race back home in his own country and not only that he won the race in 2021, 22 and also now in 23. 
                    Lets hope he also wins 24!
